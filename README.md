# 100 GbE TCP offload Engine

This repository implements from OSI layer 3 to above and is part of Limago. To generate the complete stack please refer to [Limago](https://github.com/hpcn-uam/Limago)

## Prerequisites

*Make sure that Vivado-HLS is in the PATH and you are running a supported version*

- Vivado-HLS 2018.2 or Vivado-HLS 2018.3

If you are not sure what version is running execute the following command:

```
vivado_hls -version
```


## Getting Started

Execute `make` in the root folder, a new folder named `synthesis_results` will be created. After the folder creation the project will launch the Synthesis of the different IP-Cores. Be patient this may take around 10 minutes.

## Explore the IP-Cores

You can check the synthetized project under `synthesis_results`. For instance, if you want to open the TOE

```
vivado_hls -p synthesis_results/TOE_hls_prj/
```


## Citation
If you use the TCP/IP stack or the checksum computation in your project please cite one of the following papers and/or link to the github project:
